# **Challenge: Voting Age Checker**

## Description

This code should be able to state and verify a voter's age
And compare it to a set voting age  
In order to return a value containing the voter's name and
if they are old enough to vote

Code should also ask for Input for the specific voter's name
Be able to return a correct value based on name

This code should use *min_age* and a defined *can_vote* functions  
in order to state and verify ages of all the listed voters

It should also set the ages of the voters with their:

1. Name
2. Age

### Ex. Code

```python
min_age = 18
 
participants = {
    'alice': {'age': 18},
    'bob': {'age': 40},
    'charlotte': {'age': 17},
}


# Write a function that would allow 
# A Boolean output corresponding to their age 
# And if the person can vote

```

### Testing

- Use ```print``` unit tests that set age and compare back to the minimum age
- Use unit tests that check for precise spelling and comparisons
