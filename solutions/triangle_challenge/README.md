# Challenge: Triangular Sequence Formula

## Description

Write a function that defines the triangular number sequence
with a formula
and input ability in order to insert several different
integer inputs

The triangle sequence goes as follows:

```python
1, 3, 6, 10, 15 
```

It is a formula of ***n(n+1)/2*** where ***n***
is any given number in the sequence (easier read as {1+2+3+4...})
If you wanted to check for the 5th number of the sequence,
It would look like 5(5+1)/2 = 15
*Ex. Code*

```python
triangle(1) ➞ 1

triangle(6) ➞ 21

triangle(215) ➞ 23220
```

### Testing

- Use assertion tests to check for integer inputs to
ensure the right output is given
